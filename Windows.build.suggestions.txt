Conciderations for building for windows:
 It has been many years since I developed anything for windows but here are some thoughts

Git for windows will have to be installed on the "development" machine
https://git-scm.com/download/win




Using MinGW
To build the application run qmake and mingw32-make from the project directory.

> qmake CMakeLists.txt
> mingw32-make

Using Microsoft Tools

> qmake CMakeLists.txt
> nmake release
> cd release
> mt.exe -manifest DepthForge
.exe.manifest -outputresource:DepthForge.exe


here is some information on deployment the windows os
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/deployment.html
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html

qt will have to be installed on end user machine for the application to work.
https://www.qt.io/download

This is a software distribution under the GPL Liciense so the open source it will use the free qt
	not a comercial license

a distributable windows install program should be the end result.
